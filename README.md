# NumberGuesserGame

First .NET application!

NumberGuesser is a simple game that pits the user against the CPU by comparing user-entered integers to a random integer
(used with the Random() object) that the computer has selected and stored as the correct number (goalNum)

Once user guesses the answer, they are prompted with a 'play again?' question and the user can choose to repeat the game
with a new random integer to guess. If the user enters "No" or anything starting with an "N", the application quits.
